# Cafe Management System with Expo ðŸš€

Welcome to my **Cafe Management System**, an application built using [Expo](https://expo.dev) and designed to streamline cafe operations for cashiers, admins, and managers for my final test.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and start developing the app.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. If not, download and install them [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install

   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```
